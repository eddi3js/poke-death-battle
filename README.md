## Pokemon Death Battle

We will be rebuilding this app in our bi-weekly **Js/React Deep Dive** meetings. Once completed, those who participated should have a base level understanding of:

- Next 13 (in `/app` directory)
- Async Components
- Installing and working with TailwindCss
- Server-side data fetching in components
- Client-side data fetching with Tanstack Query
- Using Vercel for hosting
- Creating/connecting to a Planetscale database
- Integrating `@planetscale/database` JavaScript driver
- Working with data to calculate results

## What is the stack?

- [Next.js (v13)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) `// for app`
- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) `// for client-side data`
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) `// for making things look nice`
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) `// to persist data`
- [PlanetScale Serverless JS Driver](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) `//to make changes in the db`
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) `// for hosting`
